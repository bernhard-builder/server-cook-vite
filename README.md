🍳 Server Cook — The Ultimate Localhost Manager & Port Controller
Stop fighting "Port 3000 is already in use." Server Cook is a professional-grade process manager and dev server dashboard for VS Code. Instantly identify, manage, and terminate zombie processes with one click.

⚡ Why Server Cook?
Development environments are messy. Between Next.js, Docker, and Vite, ports often stay open in the background, leading to the dreaded EADDRINUSE error. Server Cook provides a Mission Control interface to keep your localhost environment clean.

🔍 Real-time Port Scanner & Listener
Process Identification: Uses native lsof and netstat to resolve process names like Node.js, Python, and Go.

Visual Dashboard: A high-end Control Panel to monitor every active listener on your machine.

Smart Port Conflict Controller: Highlights port collisions instantly, preventing workflow breaks.

👻 The Ultimate Zombie Process Killer
Ghost Detector: Automatically flags orphaned servers running in deleted directories.

Force Terminate: One-click kill process functionality for unresponsive or hidden servers.

Nuke Cache: Built-in support to clear .turbo, .next, and node_modules build caches for Turborepo and Nx.

🛠️ Integrated Ecosystem Support
Server Cook is optimized for modern Fullstack and Monorepo architectures:

Frameworks: Native detection for Vite, React, Next.js, and Flask.

Monorepo Tools: Specialized logic for Turborepo, Nx, and Lerna workspaces.

Containers: Monitor ports exposed by Docker containers.

🎮 Pro-Workflow Features
Hyperlink Access: Click any port to open it in your browser or jump to the source directory.

Low Latency: Lightweight background polling ensures your IDE remains fast.

Dark Mode Native: Perfectly matches your VS Code theme with a modern Glassmorphic design.

📖 Installation & Usage
Install from the VS Code Marketplace or Open VSX.
